# Enhanced Features Implementation Summary

This document outlines the implementation of missing features based on manager feedback for the order management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Product Variant Concept ✅
**Requirement**: SKU with variants like "Progas 13kg" with variants "full" or "empty"

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced existing `products` table with proper variant support
- Added fields: `variant_type`, `parent_product_id`, `variant_name`, `is_variant`, `has_variants`
- Database functions to handle variant relationships
- Weight calculation logic for full vs empty cylinders

**Key Components**:
- Database schema supports parent-child product relationships
- Full cylinders: `tare_weight_kg + capacity_kg`
- Empty cylinders: `tare_weight_kg` only
- TypeScript types in `/src/types/product.ts`

### 2. Truck Management System with Capacity Tracking ✅
**Requirement**: Truck management system with capacity tracking

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `truck` table with `capacity_kg` field
- Created `truck_allocations` table for order-to-truck assignments
- Created `truck_maintenance` table for maintenance scheduling
- Capacity calculation functions in database

**Key Components**:
- Truck capacity in both cylinders and weight (kg)
- Real-time capacity utilization tracking
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking
- Backend API in `/backend/src/routes/trucks.ts`

### 3. Order Allocation to Trucks with Date Tracking ✅
**Requirement**: Order allocation to trucks with date tracking

**Implementation**:
- New `truck_allocations` table with comprehensive tracking
- Order allocation service with intelligent truck selection
- Capacity validation and optimization algorithms
- Date-based allocation tracking

**Key Components**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE truck_allocations (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    truck_id uuid REFERENCES truck(id),
    order_id uuid REFERENCES orders(id),
    allocation_date date NOT NULL,
    estimated_weight_kg numeric(10,2),
    actual_weight_kg numeric(10,2),
    stop_sequence integer,
    status varchar(50) CHECK (status IN ('planned', 'loaded', 'delivered', 'cancelled')),
    -- ... additional tracking fields
);
```

### 4. Truck Capacity vs Order Weight Comparison ✅
**Requirement**: Truck capacity vs order weight comparison

**Implementation**:
- Automatic order weight calculation based on product variants
- Real-time capacity checking with overallocation detection
- Intelligent truck suggestion algorithm with scoring
- Visual capacity indicators and warnings

**Key Features**:
- Weight calculation: `calculate_order_weight()` database function
- Capacity checking: `check_truck_capacity()` database function
- Allocation suggestions with scoring (0-100)
- Utilization percentage tracking

### 5. Full vs Refill Order Concept ✅
**Requirement**: Refill = get 1 full, give 1 empty

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `orders` table with order types: `delivery`, `refill`, `exchange`, `pickup`
- Stock movement system with `stock_movements` table
- Automatic stock movement processing for refill orders
- Trigger-based inventory updates

**Key Components**:
```sql
-- Order types already exist in orders table
order_type: 'delivery' | 'refill' | 'exchange' | 'pickup'
exchange_empty_qty: integer
requires_pickup: boolean

-- Stock movements tracking
CREATE TABLE stock_movements (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id uuid REFERENCES products(id),
    movement_type varchar(50), -- 'delivery', 'pickup', 'refill', 'exchange', etc.
    qty_full_in integer,
    qty_full_out integer, 
    qty_empty_in integer,
    qty_empty_out integer,
    -- ... additional fields
);
```

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Tables Created:
1. **`truck_allocations`** - Order-to-truck allocation tracking
2. **`truck_maintenance`** - Truck maintenance scheduling
3. **`stock_movements`** - Inventory movement tracking

### Enhanced Tables:
1. **`truck`** - Added `capacity_kg` field
2. **`orders`** - Added `assigned_truck_id`, `truck_assigned_date`
3. **`order_lines`** - Added `estimated_weight_kg`

### Database Functions:
- `calculate_order_weight(order_id)` - Calculate total order weight
- `check_truck_capacity(truck_id, date)` - Check truck capacity utilization
- `process_refill_order(order_id)` - Process refill order stock movements

## Backend API Enhancements

### New Routes:
1. **Stock Movements** (`/backend/src/routes/stock-movements.ts`)
   - List, create, and manage stock movements
   - Bulk movement operations
   - Movement summaries and analytics

2. **Order Allocation** (`/backend/src/lib/order-allocation.ts`)
   - Intelligent truck allocation service
   - Capacity calculation and validation
   - Allocation suggestions with scoring

### Enhanced Routes:
1. **Orders** (`/backend/src/routes/orders.ts`)
   - Truck allocation endpoints
   - Order weight calculation
   - Refill order processing
   - Daily schedule generation

2. **Trucks** (`/backend/src/routes/trucks.ts`)
   - Capacity management endpoints
   - Allocation tracking
   - Maintenance scheduling

## Frontend Type System

### New Types Added:
- `AllocationSuggestion` - Truck allocation recommendations
- `StockMovement` - Inventory movement tracking
- `TruckMaintenanceRecord` - Maintenance tracking
- `OrderWeight` - Order weight breakdown
- Enhanced `TruckAllocation` with order details

### Utility Functions:
1. **Truck Allocation** (`/src/utils/truck-allocation.ts`)
   - Capacity utilization calculations
   - Allocation validation
   - Route efficiency metrics
   - Fleet utilization analytics

2. **Stock Movements** (`/src/utils/stock-movements.ts`)
   - Movement type categorization
   - Quantity formatting
   - Trend analysis
   - Movement insights

## Key Business Logic

### Order Weight Calculation:
```typescript
// Full cylinder weight = tare_weight + gas_capacity
// Empty cylinder weight = tare_weight only
if (product.is_variant && product.variant_name === 'full') {
    unitWeight = product.tare_weight_kg + product.capacity_kg;
} else if (product.is_variant && product.variant_name === 'empty') {
    unitWeight = product.tare_weight_kg;
}
```

### Truck Allocation Scoring:
- Base score: 50 points for sufficient capacity
- Utilization bonus: 60-85% utilization = +30 points
- Order count bonus: ≤3 orders = +15 points
- Capacity penalties for overallocation

### Refill Order Processing:
1. Order status changes to 'delivered'
2. Trigger calls `process_refill_order()`
3. Creates stock movements:
   - Full cylinders OUT (delivery)
   - Empty cylinders IN (pickup)
4. Updates inventory balances automatically

## Integration Points

### Database Triggers:
- Order line changes → Recalculate order weight
- Order delivered → Process stock movements
- Stock movements → Update inventory balances

### API Integration:
- All endpoints support tenant isolation (RLS)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Real-time capacity calculations
- Bulk operation support

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes:
- `truck_allocations(truck_id, allocation_date)`
- `stock_movements(product_id, movement_date)`
- `truck_maintenance(truck_id, scheduled_date)`

### Caching Strategy:
- Capacity calculations cached per request
- Allocation suggestions computed on-demand
- Movement summaries aggregated in database

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- All new tables have tenant isolation policies
- User-based access control
- Audit logging for critical operations

### Validation:
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Business rule enforcement
- Capacity constraint checking

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics Tracked:
- Truck utilization percentages
- Order allocation efficiency
- Stock movement patterns
- Maintenance schedules

### Reporting Capabilities:
- Daily truck schedules
- Fleet utilization reports
- Stock movement summaries
- Capacity planning insights

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. Route optimization algorithms
2. Predictive maintenance scheduling
3. Advanced inventory forecasting
4. Mobile driver applications
5. Real-time GPS tracking integration

## Migration and Deployment

### Database Migration:
- Applied as `implement_truck_allocation_and_capacity_management`
- Includes all tables, functions, and triggers
- Backwards compatible with existing data

### API Deployment:
- New routes added to existing tRPC router
- Backwards compatible endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling

This implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced logistics management with comprehensive truck allocation, capacity planning, and inventory tracking capabilities.
