# Tax System Implementation

## Overview

As requested by management, we have implemented a comprehensive tax system that meets the requirement: **"Tax - not defined at time of order. Should be linked to productâ€¦and fixed in pricing."**

## Key Features

### âœ… Product-Linked Tax Information
- Each product now has tax category and tax rate fields
- Tax categories: Standard (16% VAT), Exempt (0%), Zero Rated (0%), Luxury (25%), Reduced (8%)
- Default tax rate: 16% VAT for Kenya

### âœ… Fixed Tax in Pricing
- Tax amounts are **pre-calculated** and stored in price list items
- No dynamic tax calculation at order time
- Tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive prices are both stored
- Automatic tax calculation when creating/updating price list items

### âœ… Order Creation with Fixed Tax
- Orders capture tax information at creation time (fixed)
- Tax rates and amounts don't change after order creation
- Order lines include: base price, tax amount, and total price

## Database Changes

### Products Table
```sql
-- New columns added
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD COLUMN tax_category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'standard',
ADD COLUMN tax_rate NUMERIC(5,4) DEFAULT 0.16;
```

### Price List Items Table
```sql
-- New columns added
ALTER TABLE price_list_item 
ADD COLUMN price_excluding_tax NUMERIC(10,2),
ADD COLUMN tax_amount NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN price_including_tax NUMERIC(10,2);
```

### Automatic Tax Calculation
- Database trigger automatically calculates tax amounts when price list items are created/updated
- Ensures consistency and prevents manual calculation errors

## Frontend Updates

### Product Management
- Product forms now include tax category and tax rate fields
- Product tables display tax information
- Tax categories are selectable from predefined list

### Pricing Management

- Tax information is displayed alongside pricing

### Order Creation

- Tax amounts are preserved for historical accuracy
